<para>
On FreeBSD, nginx can be installed either from the <link
url="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/#pkgng-intro">packages</link>
or through the
<link url="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/#ports-using">ports</link>
system.
The ports system provides greater flexibility, allowing selection among
a wide range of options.
The port will compile nginx with the specified options and install it.
